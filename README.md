# Generalised-Meta-Attention-Architecture
Generalised MetaAttention Architecture is a reasoning-first neural framework that extends Transformers with meta-attention, epistemic confidence, rule induction, and self-critique. It enables models to reason about their own reasoning, detect uncertainty, reduce hallucinations, and support safer, interpretable real-world AI systems.
